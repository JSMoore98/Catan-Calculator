        <b>Program Description:</b><br>
        This program allows you to input a Settlers of Catan game board and it will calculate the best spots for a
        player to place their initial settlements.
        The calculations used are modified versions of the ones in the article
        <a style="font-size: 1em;" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/college.math.j.46.4.275"

          Settlers of Catan: Using Settlement Placement Strategies in the Probability Classroom"</a>.

      <h2 id="howToUse">How to Use the Program</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Setting Up the Board:</b><br><br>
        Each letter is a potential settlement location.<br><br>
        There are 19 Tiles each with a number value input box and a material selection box.<br><br>
        When creating the board, a valid game board should have:<br>
        - <b>Materials:</b> 4 Tiles Each of: Wood, Wheat, Sheep | 3 Tiles Each of: Ore, Brick | 1 Tile of: Desert<br>
        - <b>Values:</b> 1 Each of: (2,12), 2 Each of: (3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11)<br><br>
        The desert should be given a number value of 0.<br><br>

        If the game board isn’t set up using a valid configuration, the program will give you a warning about it. The
        program will still run fine, but some of the calculations may produce less accurate results, specifically the
        Resource Plenty Score. The others will typically still be accurate. <br><br>

        The Randomize Board button will give you a randomized board already in a valid configuration. <br><br>

        <b>Optional Adjustment Boxes:</b><br><br>
        Avoid Duplicate Numbers: (Affects to Max Cards Score) Many players like to avoid duplicate numbers to maximize
        the chance of drawing a card every turn. Turning this on reduces the weight of duplicate numbers on a settlement
        location.<br><br>

        Increase Wheat Priority: (Affects the Resource Plenty Score) Wheat is arguably the most valuable material in the
        game. Turning this on increases the weight from 1/4 to 1/3, which increases its value a bit.<br><br>

        Reduce Neighbor's Priority: (Affects the Neighbors Score) The Neighbors Score tends to undervalue the actual
        settlement location and overvalue the neighbors, so turning this on reduces the weight of neighbors from 1/2 to
        1/4, so the actual settlement location is given a higher value.<br><br>

        For more specific details about how these adjustments change the results, see the "How the Calculations Work"
        section below.<br><br>

      <h2 id="readResults">Reading the Results</h2>
      <p>
        There are five scores that the program generates, each with their own strengths and way of analyzing the
        board.<br><br>

        <b>Max Cards Score:</b> This calculates the probability of the expected number of cards each turn. Usually
        players
        trying to maximize this strategy dislike having duplicate values because it reduces the odds of having at least
        one card each turn, so the Avoid Duplicate Numbers optional adjustment lowers the value of duplicates.<br><br>

        <b>Resource Plenty Score:</b> This calculates the probability of drawing a card while multiplying that number by
        the
        weight of the material. Wood, Sheep, and Wheat have 4 tiles while Ore and Bricks only have 3 tiles on a board,
        so those two materials are given a more valuable weight.<br><br>

        <b>Resource Rarity Score:</b> This is a more advanced version of the Resource Plenty Score. Instead of just
        having the
        material weight based on the number of tiles they have, it calculates the actual dot number values on each of
        those tiles to see which material is the most to least rare. The most rare materials are given a higher weight
        and priority.<br><br>

        <b>Neighbors Score:</b> This looks at the possible neighbors that could be expanded to from a settlement and
        gives a
        score based on the sum of all the neighbors.<br><br>

        <b>Best Neighbors Score:</b> This only looks at the best neighbor out of all the possible neighbors and uses
        that score
        instead of summing up every neighbor. <br><br>
        - Between the two neighbor scores, the Best Neighbors Score is riskier with a higher reward because there’s
        usually only one really good neighbor. If it’s taken before a player can settle there, the rest might be bad.
        The Neighbors Score is safer but with a lower reward, because there might not be a single settlement to expand
        to that’s as good as the Best Neighbors Score, but the average will be higher so the player should have multiple
        decent settlement options.<br><br>

        <b>Which Score is the Best?</b>
        There’s no objectively best score, but the Resource Rarity Score is the most robust and typically the most
        useful, so it could be argued to be the best. The Neighbors and Best Neighbor Scores are also useful, because
        having other good settlements to expand to as the game progresses is critical. Having a settlement with a high
        Resource Rarity and Neighbors Score is probably going to be the best. But the most useful score also depends a
        lot on the individual player and their strategy. A player who loves to trade would probably value the Max Card
        Score more. Overall, looking at the information from all of the scores is the best way to strategize; they all
        give very useful info.<br><br>

      <h2 id="calculations">How the Calculations Work</h2>
      <p>
        Here are the in depth calculations for each of the 5 scores. Note: “dots” are the number of dice combinations
        that produce a given number. For example, a tile with the value 4 has 3 dots.<br><br>

        <b>Max Cards Score: Σ(dots/36)</b><br><br>
        - Sums up all of the dots of the tiles the settlement touches and divides by 36, which is the number of possible
        dice combinations.<br><br>
        - If the Avoid Duplicate Numbers optional adjustment is checked, each encountered duplicate’s dots are divided
        by
        2 to lower their value.<br><br>

        <b>Resource Plenty Score: Σ(dots/36) * Weight</b><br><br>
        - Weight is ¼ for Wood, Sheep, and Wheat because they have four tiles each on a board. Weight is ⅓ for Ore and
        Bricks because they only have three tiles each, so they’re more rare.<br><br>
        - If the Increase Wheat Priority optional adjustment is checked, Wheat is given a ⅓ weight instead to increase
        its
        value a bit.<br><br>

        <b>Resource Rarity Score: Σ(dots/dots material total)</b><br><br>
        - dotsMaterialTotal is the sum of all of the dots for each material. For example, if the Ore tiles are 5, 4, and
        2, the dots are 4, 3, and 1, so the material total is 8. This gives higher weight to the rarer materials since
        demand will be higher.<br><br>

        <b>Neighbors Score: R (settlement) + ½ Σ R (settlement’s neighbors)</b><br><br>
        - R (location) is the Resource Rarity Score of the settlement being evaluated. R (location’s neighbors) is the
        Resource Rarity Score of one of the settlement’s neighbors, which is any settlement two spaces away. So it takes
        the sum of all the neighbors’ Resource Rarity Scores and halves it because that score isn’t as important as the
        actual settlement’s score.<br><br>
        - Turning on the Reduce Neighbor’s Priority optional adjustment reduces the weight of the neighbors’ sum from
        1/2
        to 1/4, so the actual settlement location is given a higher value.<br><br>

        <b>Best Neighbors Score: R (settlement) + ½ R (settlement’s best neighbor)</b><br><br>
        - R (location) is the Resource Rarity Score of the settlement being evaluated. R (best neighbor) is only the
        highest Resource Rarity Score out of all the neighbors instead of summing them all up. It’s then divided by
        2.<br><br>
